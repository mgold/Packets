PACKETS
A network simulator by Max Goldstein

Packets consists of a core and modules.  The core consists of:
main.py (run this to see vanilla mode)
Device.py
Link.py
Packet.py
topology.txt
loadLevel.py
music.wav

Avoid modifying the core.

There are ways to extend the core (for example, to model specific protocols) by
subclassing Device, using a different network topology, and passing functions to
configure Device and Link objects. See loadLevel.py for more documentation, or
see OSPFmain.py and Router.py for an example.
