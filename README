PACKETS
A simulator by Max Goldstein

The core consists of:
main.py (run this to see vanilla mode)
Device.py
Link.py
Packet.py
topology.txt
loadLevel.py
music.wav

There are ways to extend the core (for example, to model specific protocols) by
subclassing and function pointers. See loadLevel.py for more documentation, or
see OSPFmain.py and Router.py for an example.
