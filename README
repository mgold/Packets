PACKETS
A network simulator by Max Goldstein

In theory, that's any network. The core does little more than draw cicles
connected with lines and move rectangles along them. There are ways to extend
the core (for example, to model specific protocols) by subclassing Device, using
a different network topology, and passing functions to configure Device and Link
objects. 

Currently, there's only one such extension, modeling mostly internet routing
protocols. All of the associated files are in the top-level directory (Python
packages wouldn't cooperate). The core files are in the directory core.
